\section{Introduction}
This report describes a new model for optimised traffic signal planning using a MILP formulation. Previously, \trbcite{lin2004enhanced} describe a MILP formulation for optimised traffic signal planning based on the Cell Transmission Model of \trbcite{daganzo1995cell}. However a CTM based model is limited in scalability by the requirement that each road way in the network must be partitioned up into segments that take exactly $\DT[]=1$ to traverse at the free flow speed. We get around this limitation by using a queue based model that supports non-homogeneous time steps, and we will show how we can exploit this property to scale a network without significant increase in the number of variables or loss of quality.
