\section{Conclusion}
We have demonstrated that by exploiting the non-homogeneous time steps supported by the QTM, we are able to scale the model up to larger networks and using the same number of binary variables as a homogeneous time step, and with the same quality of a homogeneous solution using more binary variables.
