\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we showed how to formulate a novel queue transmission model (QTM)
of traffic flow with non-homogeneous time steps as a linear program.  We
then proceeded to allow the traffic signals to become discrete variables subject
to a delay minimizing optimization objective and standard traffic signal
constraints leading to a final MILP formulation of traffic signal control with
non-homogeneous time steps.  We
experimented with this novel QTM-based MILP control in a range of traffic networks
and demonstrated that the non-homogeneous MILP formulation
achieved (i) substantially lower delay solutions, (ii) improved per-car delay distributions,
and (iii) more optimal travel times over a longer horizon 
in comparison to the homogeneous MILP formulation with the same number of binary
and continuous variables.

%same quality of a homogeneous solution using more binary
%variables.
Altogether, this work represents a
major step forward in the scalability of MILP-based jointly optimized traffic
signal control via the use of a non-homogeneous time traffic models and thus helps
pave the way for fully optimized joint urban traffic signal controllers as an
improved successor technology to existing signal control methods.

Our future work includes learning the QTM parameters (e.g., turn probabilities
\FTURN{i}{j} and expected incoming flows \QIN{i}{n}) from loop detector data,
and evaluating the impact in scalability of different non-homogeneous
discretizations and size of the computer cluster used for computing the control
plans.
