Notes for writing introduction
==============================

- Strongly push on non-homogenous motivation
- Defend omission of nonlinear control
- Precedent for propagation time without nonlinear flow
- QTM: Hybrid of Gartner of Lin and Wang
- Don't motivate too much from Lin and Wang
- Major / minor frame just for experiments

- Related work (purpose is to say why our work is novel)
  (Combine with Intro?  See Steve's article.)
... MILP-based control: no one is non-homogenous
... CTM / Link: no one is non-homogenous, can change time but need to reallocate traffic for new cell lengths and next to impossible -- don't claim has not been done, but difficult to combine with MILP control


Notes for background work discussion
====================================

CTM
===

daganzo1994cell - original CTM development

daganzo1995cell - original CTM development

alecsandru2011assessment - general CTM survey noting wide use in many areas

xiaojian2010urban - variable CTM, adjustable cell length

jabari2012stochastic - alternative to CTM for modeling random headways

sumalee2011stochastic - stochastic CTM for modeling mean and standard deviation of traffic flow accurately

muralidharan2009freeway - link-node-CTM, better for arteries+freeway

lu2011discrete - lagged CTM, some sort of improvement

kim2002online - situational CTM, defines more cell types to better model boundary conditions of CTM simulation

huang2011traffic - CTM-Urban, claims CTM was for freeways, and defines extensions to better model urban traffic

gomes2006optimal - assymetric CTM (merge imbalance), freeway ramp metering

MISSING: Knoop et al, Network Transmission Model, more macroscopic variation on CTM, reduces under certain conditions


Control
===

canepa2012exact - not control, but traffic density estimation

gartner1974optimization - green wave coordination MILP?

gartner2002arterial - green wave coordination MILP?  (OPAC?)

han2012link - link-based MILP (road not divided into cells, criticizes CTM as having too many cells, still approximates shockwaves somehow)

el2013multiagent - MARLIN, pairwise Qlearning

lo1998novel - CTM, MILP introduction

lo1999dynamic - CTM, genetic algorithm solution to MILP

lin2004enhanced - CTM-based MILP

he2011pamscod - optimized solutions to MILP signal coordination (travel-time oriented)

he2014multi - multimodal extensions to MILP signal coordination

he2010heuristic - heuristic solutions to MILP signal coordination

smith2013surtrac - SURTRAC, scheduling for green waves

MISSING other optimized control: Also, PRODYN, RHODES... should ideally include these.
