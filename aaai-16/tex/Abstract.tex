As urban traffic congestion is on the increase worldwide, it is
critical to maximize capacity and throughput of existing road
infrastructure through optimized traffic signal control.  To this end,
we build on the body of work in mixed integer linear programming
(MILP) approaches that attempt to jointly optimize traffic signal
control over an entire traffic network and specifically on
improving the scalability of these methods for large numbers of
intersections.  Our primary insight in this work stems from the fact
that MILP-based approaches to traffic control used in a receding
horizon control manner (that replan at fixed time intervals) need to
compute high fidelity control policies only for the early stages of
the signal plan; therefore, coarser time steps can be employed to
``see'' over a long horizon to preemptively adapt to distant platoons
and other predicted long-term changes in traffic flows.  To this end,
we contribute the queue transmission model (QTM) which blends elements
of cell-based and link-based modeling approaches to enable a
non-homogeneous time MILP formulation of traffic signal control.
%
We then experiment with this novel QTM-based MILP control in a range
of traffic networks and demonstrate that the non-homogeneous MILP
formulation achieves (i) substantially lower delay solutions, (ii)
improved per-car delay distributions, and (iii) more optimal travel
times over a longer horizon in comparison to the homogeneous MILP
formulation with the same number of binary and continuous variables.
